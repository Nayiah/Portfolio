            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Ja'Nayiah Jackson, and I recently graduated from Dillard University with a degree in Computer
                Science and a minor in Mathematics.</p>

            <p>I'm interested in the technology field, and I'm currently looking for opportunities to start my
                career. My main goal is to go into web development and eventually work my way into being a full stack
                developer with this website being proof of my passion. I enjoy learning new things, solving problems,
                and working on meaningful projects.</p>

            <p>In my free time, I like spending time with family and friends, reading, playing video games (strategic,
                RPG, life sim, and action/adventure) and music. Some of my interests are coding, gaming, and music. I
                also enjoy exploring new technologies and keeping up with the latest trends in the tech industry.</p>

            <p>Thank you for visiting my website!
            </p>
